  title: Success Story
  content: Meet Samira, she’s 12 years old and wants to be a videogame designer when
    she grows up.  She studies hard at school and helps her family prepare dinner
    when she doesn’t have too much homework.  However, her school system does not
    have any technology classes like private schools.  Fortunately, there is a computer
    lab less than 2km from her school that Think Tools hosts lessons from.  She’s
    been spending less time playing video games and more time on learning the tools
    so that one day she can achieve her dream.
